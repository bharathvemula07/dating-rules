we're listening for three years you

learn some things in some certain rules

you have fun especially if you're dating

an Indian girl because Indian girls have

a lot of restrictions unfortunately so

it's like I feel every Indian girl who

has to lie to our parents to date a guy

is like in a covert like Russian spy

mission she's always on the lookout

so what I learned from this is met her

mom calls you never disturb that call do

not disturb the girl and her mother call

okay here are certain science to know

her mom is calling if a phone is ringing

she's like that's not a mom

one second

the children will be studying actually

studying dance yeah mom yeah so never

but never mess with her I've seen I've

seen girlfriends turn into hogs

so it's failed they punched me in the

face levels very scary second rule never

this is such a stupid thing guys you

never try to make your girlfriend

jealous just look at the scenario look

at the scenario in this club right now

single guys single girls whew a single

girl in India in India with the

population of a billion 99% of them are

silica is you know the amount of

attention she is getting it's a

privilege that she's like okay for this

few months you I will get my full

attention and you think oh this one girl

he told me let me show come on

it is the most dumbest

you can ever do there's also the things

guys feel like very simple we like to

get people simply shake so one girl

flirts with me let's [ __ ] completed in

my culture oh yeah she's going to value

me more now oh hey guess what happened

today check what a girl was flirting

with me jealous you think she gave you a

10 she let me let me deliver the guys

who he told me while I went to the bus

stop five minutes back page you want

rule number three this is a very weird

thing but it shows your character you

have to drop your girlfriend to the

autorickshaw okay make sense pose when

it gets dark makes sense

but if it's before 5 p.m. it makes no

sense to me okay because guys are

horrible at catching or directions like

women are awesome because guys believe

in physics

women don't ok they don't like if I've

seen order it just hit motorbikes and

hit guys crossing the road

my god scissor shoot two stops in auto

auto just stops here

sheis tops the problem is guys also he

has his problem we used logic okay when

you try to stop an auto v like hey no

that's going in the opposite direction

we can stop that auto he looks tired I

don't need and the worst part is the

thing about catching orders like I hate

doing this cuz you have to judge the

article if it's like dark like it's 7

p.m.

well you know you don't have to like

drop your girlfriend it's like you have

to judge the auto driver because it's

for real okay here looks like murderer

he looks like a please no need bye-bye

oh he looks he looks very weak

malnutrition says the cancer comes

nothing he'll do not seem sad if you do

that and oh and the most amazing thing

guys think they do is the K baby once

you reach oh send me a text

what what good that doesn't have no idea

cuz in case your Auto explodes I'll get

an SMS it makes no sense also one thing

is like guys don't know how to say sorry

they don't though so like who's in

relationship give me give it said how

would he say sorry to your girlfriend

yeah exactly

you know you don't just say I'm sorry

man have you noticed see guys have this

ego so they don't apologize a lot but

women apologies Lord have you noticed

and if it's a good or a bad thing but

it's very clever what do you do they

have this bank where they collect a lot

of saris this is sorry flick stupid [ __ ]

that doesn't matter like oh my god I

know your ass for Apple but this like a

banana is that okay okay I'm so sorry

you know I'm five minutes late I said

okay yeah it's it's fine

you don't have to apologize oh sure and

then you screw up she's a baby

laughs already so many casualties piece

of Vegas let me know any it's gonna get

better

so and then then we see I'm sorry

and she think it's like that just like

that sorry six know what is do you have

to make it dramatic you have to say

sorry but just like being like Channing

Tatum times just like bad acting but you

screw up go to be like just talk about

on stuff like yeah today morning I took

the bus just pretty crowded

yeah the vet has been kind of yards

butter yesterday what happen I just want

to say that I'll never talk to you like

that again and stop mid-sentence and

walk away and then stop

hopefully if it's raining it'll be

creative I just want to say I'm sorry I

kept you small cute cousin just be 150

rupees and make the cousin come up to

your
